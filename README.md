# A comprehensivist study guide

Comprehensive thinking is an attempt to integrate what we have learned about Universe in order to gain a clearer understanding of our world and how to make it work for everyone.

This open artifacts project attempts to define an study guide for anyone wanting to build their understanding of comprehensive thinking.

Ultimately, the study guide would be in the form of a website. I'm looking at the [Common Core Curriculum](http://www.corestandards.org/) as a guide, but I'm not sure yet if the study guide should have the form of a set of educational standards.

To contribute to the project, you can fork this repository and then submit a pull request with any contribution you make. If you're not so technically adept, you're welcome to contact Jim Applegate by going to https://www.JimApplegate.com/contact/.

This is in the early stages, but here is a simple list of topics. This first list includes some of the basics of clear thinking:

* Critical Thinking
* Science
	* Scientific method
	* Discoveries of science
	* History of science
* World geography
* World history
